The SAP focus is on three key abilities:

(I) Ability to provide **best practice guidance** on the architectural design across multiple applications and projects of the enterprise as well as an ability to map business objectives to application/architecture requirements

(II) Ability to **evaluate** cloud application requirements and make architectural recommendations for implementation, deployment, and provisioning applications on AWS.

(III) Ability to **design** a hybrid architecture using key AWS technologies (e.g., VPN, AWS Direct Connect) and a continuous integration and deployment process.
