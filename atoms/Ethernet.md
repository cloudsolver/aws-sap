Traditional Ethernet frames have a maximum transmission unit (MTU) of 1500 bytes, but Jumbo Frames can allow for frames up to 9000 bytes. The use of Jumbo Frames can improve network performance by reducing the overhead associated with transmitting data, as larger frames can result in fewer packets and less network congestion.
