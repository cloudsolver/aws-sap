#Question What are the Different Types of Factors on MFA?

There are many different examples of factors a system secured with MFA can use to increase its confidence in the identity of its users.

A password
One-time, temporary codes, sent to a mobile app
OTP (one-time password) that can be used with a web app
Biometric authentication in the form of a fingerprint or face of a user
QR codes, smart card
Because there are many different types of factors available for end-user authentication, security specialists have organized them into three categories:

Knowledge: This category refers to authentication factors where users have to prove they know something (like a password or the answer to a security question - although the latter is being used less frequently as online trawling of user data has made this method less secure).

Possession: The possession factor requires users to prove they own something (like a mobile device where they can receive an SMS code).

Inheritance: The last category is about factors where users have to verify their identity through biometrics (for example, a retina scan or facial recognition or a fingerprint scan).
