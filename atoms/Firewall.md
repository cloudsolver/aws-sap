[[OSI Layer 7 - Application]] firewalls, also known as application-layer firewalls, are a type of firewall that provides advanced security features by inspecting and filtering data at the application layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model. Traditional firewalls, such as packet filtering or stateful inspection firewalls, operate at the network and transport layers and are only capable of filtering traffic based on IP addresses, port numbers, and protocol types. In contrast, layer 7 firewalls have the ability to analyze the content of network traffic, including application protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP, and can make more granular decisions about which traffic should be allowed or blocked. In this lesson, we will explore how layer 7 firewalls work
