DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) is a suite of Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) specifications for securing certain kinds of information provided by the Domain Name System (DNS) as used on Internet Protocol (IP) networks. 

It is designed to protect against DNS attacks such as cache poisoning, where incorrect information is introduced into the DNS cache, leading to the redirection of traffic to malicious sites. Security adds a layer of security to the DNS.
