### OSI Layer 1 - Physical
**Hubs | Bitstream** 
#Q What is the scope of responsibility of this layer?
It is responsible for the physical transmission of data over a communication channel, such as a wire, cable, or wireless signal. This layer defines the physical characteristics of the communication medium, including voltage levels, cable types, and signaling methods, to ensure that data is transmitted accurately and reliably between devices.

A hub is a dumb multi-port repeater. Every device receives all the data. It has no visibility into connections. It allows the transmission of raw data over bit stream that is over the physical medium.
This is a dumb layer where frames are exchanged based on electric signals between cards directly connected. There are no controls in place that results in collision and corruption.
