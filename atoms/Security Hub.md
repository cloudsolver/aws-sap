Security Hub provides a view of the compliance posture of your AWS accounts using the CIS Benchmarks. One of these checks looks for IAM users with access keys over 90 days old.

The result is that long-term credentials are optional, and your user will have short-term credentials associated with an IAM role.

AWS Security Hub reduces the effort of collecting and prioritizing security findings across accounts from AWS services and AWS Partner Network tools. 
It has a centralized dashboard can run automated, continuous account-level configuration and compliance checks based on industry standards and best practices, such as the Center for Internet Security (CIS) AWS Foundations Benchmark.
